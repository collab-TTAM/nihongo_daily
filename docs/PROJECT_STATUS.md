## Historical handoff — Issue #1, 2026-10-13

- Completed: resolved rating/units/date/retry/ownership ambiguities; 37 named schema definitions, eight endpoint bindings, 20 fixtures, validator and 15 regression tests; dependency and merge order documented.
- Remaining: Flutter #2, database/RLS #3, SRS #4, curriculum #5 and remaining Personal Alpha modules.
- Changed files: contracts/v0.1/*, contracts/validate.py, contracts/test_contracts.py, contracts/requirements.txt, API_CONTRACTS, DATABASE_SCHEMA, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRACT_BASELINE, this status, README, CI workflow.
- API changes: typed definitions for eight already-planned operations; RPC/Edge boundaries, safe errors, bounded outputs and scoped retries.
- Database changes: specification only; user-scoped review uniqueness/original-result receipts, conversation receipts, parent-message ownership, integrity and validated write requirements. No migration applied.
- Known issues: no Flutter app or live service; fixture validation does not test deployed RLS/providers. Audio streaming/upload contract remains later work.
- Tests: local validator passed all 20 fixtures and all 15 regression tests passed. PR/current-head CI is the integration gate; see #1/its PR for evidence.
- Next task: #2 Flutter shell after #1 integration, without external credentials.
- Blockers/decisions: none for #2; live Supabase/AI/voice configuration is addressed when integration is implemented.

Personal Alpha gaps are queued as #11–#18; see CONTRACT_BASELINE for the map. Issue #16 provides real Kanji reference assets, while #6 can start synthetic primitives after #2.

## Latest handoff — Issue #2 / PR #19, 2026-10-13

- Branch: automation/issue-2-flutter-shell; base main 33f31a8 (PR #10).
- Implemented: Vietnamese Material 3 adaptive shell, GoRouter module discovery and
  unavailable pages, Riverpod-injected typed demo repository, session-only N5/N4
  and theme settings, loading/error/retry/empty handling, regression tests.
- Changed files: apps/flutter_app, README, CI workflow, .gitignore, this status.
- API/database changes: none; demo allocation does not implement get_daily_plan.
- Checks: contract validator passed 20 fixtures; 15 contract regression tests passed.
  Flutter format and analyze passed (no issues); 22 Flutter tests passed, including
  200% text on 320/375px layouts after fixing the theme dropdown overflow. Web
  release build succeeded locally again with the final dependency lock, including
  the optional Cupertino icon font. Local source matches the uploaded tree
  2554e82a1b6e5c8f787fba350bbfe8e734022bfa (code head 20e3088 before this status update).
  Exact-head CI and Windows build evidence are tracked in
  https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/pull/19/checks; repo-sanity, flutter
  (format/analyze/22 tests/web build), and windows (release build) must all pass
  before integration. Artifacts: flutter-web-preview and flutter-windows-preview.
  CI run 38407859810 passed repo-sanity and all Flutter checks, but Windows failed
  because windows-latest supplied VS 2026 and Flutter 3.35 selected the fallback
  VS 2019 CMake generator. The Windows job is now pinned to windows-2022 / VS 2022;
  no checks were removed. Current-head rerun remains the integration gate.
  Direct browser smoke was not observed:
  the local headless Chrome process crashed before the app could load.
- Known limitations: real content, auth, storage, sync, SRS, scoring, progress,
  providers and voice remain unimplemented; preview routes state this explicitly.
- Next: integrate #2 only after separate review and current-head CI; then #3
  Supabase schema/RLS. #4 can use the Dart package after #2 merge.
- Blockers: none requiring user input. Native Windows launch, iOS runner,
  signing and device validation remain later work.
