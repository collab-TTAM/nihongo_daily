## Historical handoff — Issue #1, 2026-10-13

- Completed: resolved rating/units/date/retry/ownership ambiguities; 37 named schema definitions, eight endpoint bindings, 20 fixtures, validator and 15 regression tests; dependency and merge order documented.
- Remaining: Flutter #2, database/RLS #3, SRS #4, curriculum #5 and remaining Personal Alpha modules.
- Changed files: contracts/v0.1/*, contracts/validate.py, contracts/test_contracts.py, contracts/requirements.txt, API_CONTRACTS, DATABASE_SCHEMA, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRACT_BASELINE, this status, README, CI workflow.
- API changes: typed definitions for eight already-planned operations; RPC/Edge boundaries, safe errors, bounded outputs and scoped retries.
- Database changes: specification only; user-scoped review uniqueness/original-result receipts, conversation receipts, parent-message ownership, integrity and validated write requirements. No migration applied.
- Known issues: no Flutter app or live service; fixture validation does not test deployed RLS/providers. Audio streaming/upload contract remains later work.
- Tests: local validator passed all 20 fixtures and all 15 regression tests passed. PR/current-head CI is the integration gate; see #1/its PR for evidence.
- Next task: #2 Flutter shell after #1 integration, without external credentials.
- Blockers/decisions: none for #2; live Supabase/AI/voice configuration is addressed when integration is implemented.

Personal Alpha gaps are queued as #11–#18; see CONTRACT_BASELINE for the map. Issue #16 provides real Kanji reference assets, while #6 can start synthetic primitives after #2.

## Latest handoff — Issue #2 / PR #19, 2026-10-13

- Branch: automation/issue-2-flutter-shell; base main 33f31a8 (PR #10).
- Implemented: Vietnamese Material 3 adaptive shell, GoRouter module discovery and
  unavailable pages, Riverpod-injected typed demo repository, session-only N5/N4
  and theme settings, loading/error/retry/empty handling, regression tests.
- Changed files: apps/flutter_app, README, CI workflow, .gitignore, this status.
- API/database changes: none; demo allocation does not implement get_daily_plan.
- Checks: contract validator passed 20 fixtures; 15 contract regression tests passed.
  Flutter format and analyze passed (no issues); 22 Flutter tests passed, including
  200% text on 320/375px layouts after fixing the theme dropdown overflow. Web
  release build succeeded locally again with the final dependency lock, including
  the optional Cupertino icon font. Local source matches the uploaded tree
  2554e82a1b6e5c8f787fba350bbfe8e734022bfa (code head 20e3088 before this status update).
  Exact-head CI and Windows build evidence are tracked in
  https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/pull/19/checks; repo-sanity, flutter
  (format/analyze/22 tests/web build), and windows (release build) must all pass
  before integration. Artifacts: flutter-web-preview and flutter-windows-preview.
  CI run 38407859810 passed repo-sanity and all Flutter checks, but Windows failed
  because windows-latest supplied VS 2026 and Flutter 3.35 selected the fallback
  VS 2019 CMake generator. The Windows job is now pinned to windows-2022 / VS 2022;
  no checks were removed. Current-head rerun remains the integration gate.
  Direct browser smoke was not observed:
  the local headless Chrome process crashed before the app could load.
- Known limitations: real content, auth, storage, sync, SRS, scoring, progress,
  providers and voice remain unimplemented; preview routes state this explicitly.
- Next: integrate #2 only after separate review and current-head CI; then #3
  Supabase schema/RLS. #4 can use the Dart package after #2 merge.
- Blockers: none requiring user input. Native Windows launch, iOS runner,
  signing and device validation remain later work.

## Integrated handoff — Issue #3 / PR #21, 2026-10-13

- Merged: PR #21 (https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/pull/21) as
  4dd5e134ec2bfdc93bac97ed796ba882c9e98af6; #3 completed. Shared contracts #1 and
  Flutter preview #2 are also integrated; earlier handoffs above are historical.
- Delivered: additive 22-table migration; owner/parent-message RLS; explicit
  table/column grants; allowlisted own-profile settings; backend-only scenario
  context; immutable review requests/original responses; typed curriculum FKs;
  normalized relationship FKs, indexes and checked receipt state.
- Evidence: separately reviewed head 240ef15190dbaa3ffc191cf212dba7a8c262e686.
  CI https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/actions/runs/38421789675 succeeded:
  repo-sanity (20 contract fixtures, 15 tests), database (250 SQL assertions plus
  two native concurrent sessions committing exactly one event), flutter
  (format/analyze/22 tests/web release build), windows (release build).
- Local checks: the migration/SQL suite passed on PostgreSQL 18.6 via PGlite 0.5.9;
  contract fixtures/tests, bash syntax, Python compilation and whitespace passed.
  Native PostgreSQL 17 evidence comes from CI, not this local environment.
- Review fixes: canonicalize Asia/Saigon to Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh with UTC+7 conversion
  checks; use FOR SHARE for active-content validation; revoke inherited service-role
  TRUNCATE; verify restrictive FK rejection and unchanged curriculum/history across
  observed native PG17/local PG18 error codes. No security/test gates removed.
- Not delivered: hosted Supabase/PostgREST/Auth, public submit_review, account
  lifecycle, real providers, offline sync or production deployment. Storage replay
  is not a functioning review endpoint, and the UI remains a labeled demo.
- Follow-ups: #20 real Auth/session lifecycle; #22 authenticated atomic review RPC
  after #4 pure scheduler; #7 provider-neutral validated interfaces; #17 live
  AI/voice. Read supabase/README.md for storage/export mapping and safe test setup.
- Next task: #4 deterministic pure Dart SRS on automation/issue-4-srs-core, then
  #5 original N5 content according to dependency order. #4 needs no live secrets.
  Main stays IN_PROGRESS toward Personal Alpha; no release completion claimed.

## Integrated handoff — Issue #4 / PR #24, 2026-10-13

- Merged: https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/pull/24 as
  d4ed337dc8a5bcce46bc830e0e10528b8bd04e56; #4 completed as a pure scheduler.
- Delivered: immutable Dart card/request projections, nd-srs-1 rating/transition
  rules, bounded learning/relearning/early/overdue intervals, capped review growth,
  validated counters/difficulty and deterministic UTC duration arithmetic.
- Evidence: reviewed head 7e656d445bbca00216f601fc203f14f923068b03; all jobs succeeded at
  https://github.com/collab-TTAM/nihongo_daily/actions/runs/38426443750:
  repo-sanity (20 baseline fixtures/17 regression tests), database (retained SQL/RLS
  and native race), Flutter (format/analyze without issues, full unit suite,
  26 policy cases and actual Dart output/schema validation, web release build),
  Windows (release build). Separate source and verifier lint-fix reviews recorded.
- Local evidence: raw pure-Dart execution and actual-output validation of all 26
  cases, domain/tool analysis, formatting, 17 Python tests and whitespace/syntax.
  Full Flutter package resolution was unavailable locally; full unit/build evidence
  comes from CI. No browser/native interactive smoke or hosted integration claim.
- Shared fields/enums are unchanged. docs/SRS_ALGORITHM.md specifies the heuristic,
  rounding and #22 backend parity/auth/locking/replay requirements. Versioned
  golden cases are contracts/srs/v1/golden.json. No calibrated memory prediction.
- Not integrated: SRS UI study flow, public submit_review, stored receipt replay,
  auth or durable offline persistence. #22/#15/#20 retain these responsibilities.
  MASTERED remains reserved; memory stability/retrievability are not estimated.
- Next task: #5 original schema-valid N5 seed content. #22 can now port the pure
  scheduler with authoritative transaction tests; #11's #2/#3/#4 dependencies are
  satisfied. Live configuration does not block original content work.
- Personal Alpha remains IN_PROGRESS with curriculum, study screens, real auth,
  sync, Kanji, AI/voice and integrated release evidence still outstanding.

## Development handoff — Issue #5, 2026-10-13 UTC

- Branch automation/issue-5-n5-seed, base main 73c1dc8. Original editorial N5
  seed: 24 vocabulary, 8 Kanji, 10 grammar and 44 embedded example entries.
  Stable IDs, version/count/scope manifest, Vietnamese explanations and readings.
- Added strict offline export gate and 17 mutation/regression tests; CI runs the
  gate and all existing tests. Wire models, Flutter source and database unchanged.
- Local: content/schema/count/reference validation passed; 20 baseline fixtures
  and all 34 Python tests passed; Python compile/whitespace passed. Eight stroke
  counts cross-checked against pinned KanjiVG metadata; assets not redistributed.
- Flutter SDK/native PostgreSQL are absent locally. Existing full Flutter format,
  analyze/tests/SRS output validation, web/Windows builds and SQL/race checks must
  pass in CI for the PR's exact head before integration; no such result claimed yet.
- Not full N5/N4 curriculum; no audio, reference strokes, importer, hosted service
  or UI integration. Linguistic correspondence manually reviewed by the worker;
  independent teacher review is not observed. Details/provenance in data/README.md.
- Resume this PR first, then #6 Kanji capture/synthetic primitives. #26 tracks N5 expansion; #14 can extend
  the content gate with N4; #12 consumes original exports; #16 provides real assets.
  Personal Alpha remains IN_PROGRESS; no new user action is needed for #6.

- Separate review fix: reject duplicate JSON object members and fullwidth romaji
  readings; two mutation regressions added. No validation/security gate weakened.
